grammatiker (0.2.0)

   * Fixed:
      - Patching Java code version in the Grammatica 'build.xml' file so
	that it correctly compiles with the newer Java compilers
	(e.g. openjdk version "11.0.5" on Ubuntu-18.04).

      - Sorting test case names before running tests; now the tests are
	always performed and listed in the same order, using alphabetic
	sort on test case names.

      - Adding 'ant-contrib' and 'junit' packages to the dependency
	installation scripts for Ubuntu-14.04; adding thos two and also
	'ant' and 'default-jdk' to the dependency installation scripts for
	LinuxMint-17.1.
