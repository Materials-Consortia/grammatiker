The "gramatiker" package provides tools to read BNF and EBNF grammar
files, to check their EBNF syntax, and to convert them into parser
generator format (currently suitable for Grammatica,
https://github.com/cederberg/grammatica) from which a parser for the
EBNF-described grammar can be generated. The generated parsers can be
run on-the-fly to check whether a given file conforms to the grammar
presented in (E)BNF.
